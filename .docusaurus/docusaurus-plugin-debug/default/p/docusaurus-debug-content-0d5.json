Financial contracts are basic building blocks for finance, including cash flow agreements, risk analysis and nearly all financial reports. Standardized contract term specification and cash flow generating algorithms provide a basis for all further financial analysis. In particular, the ACTUS Standard facilitates forward-looking “what if” analysis, the ability to consistently and accurately consolidate financial contract information across business units of a firm or across financial institutions, flexible and robust data aggregation, and the generation of financial reports capable of drilling down to the most granular financial contract level for any number of future scenarios. This significantly improves the understanding of both risks and opportunities.","source":"@site/docs/competition.md","sourceDirName":".","slug":"/competition","permalink":"/docs/competition","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/docs/competition.md","tags":[],"version":"current","sidebarPosition":2,"frontMatter":{"sidebar_position":2},"sidebar":"tutorialSidebar","previous":{"title":"Guide to ACTUS Portfolio Interest Rate Risk Analysis","permalink":"/docs/dadfir3-demo/Demo User Guide"},"next":{"title":"[ACTUSFRF] CORE LICENSE 1.0","permalink":"/docs/license"}},{"id":"dadfir3-demo/About","title":"Data-Driven Financial Risk and Regulatory Reporting (DaDFiR3)","description":"About the Project","source":"@site/docs/dadfir3-demo/About.md","sourceDirName":"dadfir3-demo","slug":"/dadfir3-demo/About","permalink":"/docs/dadfir3-demo/About","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/docs/dadfir3-demo/About.md","tags":[],"version":"current","sidebarPosition":1,"frontMatter":{"sidebar_position":1},"sidebar":"tutorialSidebar","previous":{"title":"ACTUS Server cURL Samples","permalink":"/docs/actus-demo/server-curl-samples"},"next":{"title":"ACTUS Rshiny Demo Guide","permalink":"/docs/dadfir3-demo/ACTUS Rshiny Demo Guide"}},{"id":"dadfir3-demo/ACTUS Rshiny Demo Guide","title":"ACTUS Rshiny Demo Guide","description":"This guide will help you install and use the ACTUS Rshiny Demo.
