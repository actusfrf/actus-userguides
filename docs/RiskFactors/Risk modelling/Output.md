# Sample Contract Simulation  

Here We Simulate Principal At Maturity (PAM) loan contracts with risk factors to analyze borrower payment patterns and cash flow impacts. 

The below file contains - Sample data for testing prepayment behavior models,
Cash flow scenarios for Principal At Maturity contracts,
Risk factor parameters or simulation inputs, and 
Expected outputs from behavioral risk modeling

```bash
 source ppm01PAMwRF_ss.txt
```
