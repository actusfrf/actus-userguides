# Possible Improvements And Extensions   

The **ACTUS Quickstart installation** provides a simplified path for a new ACTUS user to quickly set up an **ACTUS service** in their workstation environment and explore the potential of ACTUS technology using:  

- Sample contracts  
- Sample risk scenarios  
- Sample behavior risk modeling  

## Potential Improvements and Extensions  

Improvements, extensions, and supporting tools are possible in many directions. Some obvious candidates include:  

- **Automated Data Conversion**  
  - Tooling to automate conversion between raw **JSON** and more readable **comma-separated (CSV) files** or tables.  
  - This would apply to **contract specifications, reference indexes, and output event sequences**.  
  - **CSV conversion** would facilitate **import/export** into spreadsheets.  

- **Prepayment Behavior Model**  
  - The **sample Prepayment behavior model** instance provided in **ACTUS Quickstart** is mainly a **scaffolding** for validating and testing the **risk callout architecture**.  
  - No claim is made regarding its **realism or usefulness**.  

- **Additional Behavior Models**  
  - Adding basic behavior models for:  
    - **Contract default**  
    - **Deposit withdrawal**  
    - **American Option exercise behaviors**  
  - This would allow **"data-only" exploration** of behavior models by defining relevant model instances.
