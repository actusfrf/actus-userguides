# Risk Factors and ACTUS Simulation Script

Here we describe a script sequence of commands which:
- Defines and stores some sample risk factors and risk scenarios in the (mongodb) risk factor store installed as part of ACTUS Basic Quickstart.
- Defines some sample ACTUS contracts.
- Runs ACTUS simulations using the sample contracts and the predefined saved risk factors.  

The simulation requests return cashflows as JSON text strings.
