# Data-Driven Financial Risk and Regulatory Reporting (DaDFiR3)

## About the Project

### Our Vision: Reworking the reporting infrastructure.

#### We see a paradigm shift for financial regulation with:

- Timeliness, flexibility, transparency, comparability
- Improved adaptability to new situations
- Realistic systemic analysis
- Enhances regulators’ ability to mitigate adverse events

#### This will have an impact on the financial system and society:

- Financial institutions: Lower operations costs, better understanding of risks, freeing up resources for strategic tasks
- The financial system: More resilient, more efficient
- The real economy will profit from a more stable financial system
- “Society at large”: Improve financial market transparency & level the playing field between buyers and sellers
- Strengthening the role of Switzerland in FinTech
- Provides the foundation of a future digital financial infrastructure
