# Awesome Actus Library Overview

## What is Awesome Actus Library?

**Awesome Actus Library** is a Python-based modeling layer that supports **financial contract modeling using the ACTUS Standard**. It enables developers, analysts, and researchers to work with ACTUS-compliant financial contracts in a clean, structured, and user-friendly environment.

This library is not a reimplementation of ACTUS. Instead, it serves as a **high-level interface** to the ACTUS simulation backend (typically a Java-based service), helping users define, validate, and analyze financial contracts efficiently.

> ğŸ§  If you're unfamiliar with the ACTUS Standard itself, check out the [ACTUS Standard Overview](../standard/overview.md) and [Core Concepts](../standard/core-concepts.md) first.

## Purpose and Role

Awesome Actus Library is designed to:

- Provide a **Python-native modeling interface** for ACTUS contracts
- Connect to the ACTUS simulation backend to run standardized cash flow simulations
- **Automatically validate inputs** against ACTUS specfic rules (e.g applicability, time consistency, data types)
- Offer helpful and clear feedback when things go wrong
- Deliver **basic financial analytics** such as income, value, and liquidity

It acts as a **smart layer** between the user and the ACTUS engine, enabling productive, error-resilient workflows without compromising the formal rigor of the standard.

## Why This Library Matters

While the ACTUS simulation service is powerful, it is:

- **Backend-focused**: Input must follow strict, machine-readable structures
- **Not user-facing**: Minimal guidance when inputs are invalid or incomplete

Awesome Actus Library fills this gap by providing:

âœ… **Automated validation** of:
- Applicability rules (business rules for contract terms)
- Correct data types and enum values
- Time consistency (e.g., payment dates after initiation)
- Risk factor linkage and completeness

âœ… **Meaningful feedback** when validations fail  
âœ… **Convenient modeling abstractions** for Python users  
âœ… **Open source accessibility** for transparency and collaboration

## Built-In Financial Analysis

In addition to modeling and validating ACTUS contracts, the library offers utilities to analyze the output of simulations. From the generated event stream, it can calculate:

- **Income**: Accrued and realized earnings
- **Value**: Discounted present value of future cash flows
- **Liquidity**: Projected net cash position over time

These features make it possible to **go beyond raw cash flows** and directly support scenario analysis, reporting, and risk assessment workflows.
