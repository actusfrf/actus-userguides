# CashFlowStream

The `CashFlowStream` class encapsulates the **result of simulating ACTUS contracts** under a given risk factor scenario. It is the central object produced by the `generateEvents()` method of the ACTUS service.

It provides:

- A unified, flattened DataFrame of cash flow events across contracts
- A reference to the input `Portfolio`
- Optional `riskFactors` used during simulation (e.g., reference indices, yield curves)

This makes it ideal for **visualizing**, **analyzing**, and **debugging** simulation results.

## üì¶ Attributes

| Attribute      | Type              | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `portfolio`    | `Portfolio`       | The portfolio of one or more contracts used for simulation                 |
| `riskFactors`  | `list` or `None`  | Risk factor objects (e.g., `ReferenceIndex`, `YieldCurve`) used in simulation |
| `events_df`    | `pd.DataFrame`    | Flattened event table across all portfolio contracts                       |

---

## ‚úÖ Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `show(max_rows=10, full=False)` | Print a preview or the full `events_df` |
| `plot(title=None, y1_label="Notional/Principal", y2_label="Interest Payments", return_fig=False)` | Plot cash flows for either a single contract or the full portfolio |
| `__str__()` / `__repr__()` | Summary of the object (e.g., number of events, contracts) |

## üìä Plotting Behavior

The `.plot()` method adapts automatically:

- For a **single contract**, it invokes an **internal layered visualization engine** that produces a rich plot with dual Y-axes and semantic annotations (e.g., arrows for `IP`, `PR`, `IED`, dashed lines for accruals and nominal state).
- For a **multi-contract portfolio**, it automatically aggregates payoffs and generates a stacked bar chart grouped by event type and adaptive time intervals.

Both use `matplotlib` internally and support export via `return_fig=True`.

```python
fig = cf_stream.plot(return_fig=True)
fig.savefig("plots/my_cashflows.png")
```

---

### üîç What the Plot Includes (Single Contract)

For basic ACTUS contracts (e.g. PAM, ANN), the contract-level plot contains:

- Red arrows for **initial exchanges** and **maturities** (e.g., `IED`, `MD`)
- Green arrows for **interest payments** (`IP`)
- Red arrows (on Y2) for **principal redemptions** (`PR`)
- Dashed red lines for **outstanding nominal** over time
- Dashed green lines for **interest accruals** between `IP` and `RR`
- Sinusoidal wave markers between **rate reset** events (`RR`)

These layers are drawn using a modular internal system, not exposed as a public API.

---

### üìä What the Plot Includes (Portfolio)

When plotting a multi-contract portfolio, the output shows:

- Aggregated cash flows grouped by **event type**
- **Stacked bar chart** binned over time intervals (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly ‚Äì auto chosen)
- Helpful for identifying net inflows/outflows or cash flow timing mismatch

---

## üìÑ Usage Example

```python
from awesome_actus_lib import PublicActusService
cf_stream = PublicActusService().generateEvents(portfolio=my_portfolio, riskFactors=[my_curve])

cf_stream.show(max_rows=5)
cf_stream.plot()
```

---

## üìÅ Accessing Raw Events

The full set of ACTUS-generated events is stored in the `events_df` attribute:

```python
df = cf_stream.events_df
```

Each row represents one event (e.g., `IP`, `PR`, `MD`, `RR`) and includes:

- `contractId`
- `time`
- `type`
- `payoff`
- and additional ACTUS state information

---

## üß† Design Consideration

Including both `portfolio` and `riskFactors` in the `CashFlowStream` enables:

- **Traceability**: Full visibility into where each event came from
- **Analysis support**: Analyses like `ValueAnalysis` and `IncomeAnalysis` require the original input terms and discount curves
- **Plot adaptation**: Plots depend on knowing the `contractType`

This design avoids the need to manage inputs and outputs separately.

---

## üß™ Internal Behavior: `_parse_events()`

This helper flattens the nested contract simulation result:

- Walks parent and child contracts recursively
- Extracts all event lists
- Adds a `contractId` column
- Builds a unified event table for analysis

The result is assigned to `.events_df`.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

- `plot()` assumes standard ACTUS events and behavior
- For highly complex portfolios or non-standard contracts, visualizations may need custom layers
- Performance may degrade slightly with very large portfolios (hundreds of contracts)
