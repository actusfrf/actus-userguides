# üöß Troubleshooting Guide

This page lists common issues users may encounter while using the Awesome ACTUS Library and how to resolve them.

---

## ‚ùå No Events Generated

**Symptoms:**

- `CashFlowStream.events_df` is empty
- `.show()` says ‚ÄúNo events available‚Äù

**Causes:**

- Missing mandatory contract terms
- Invalid date ranges (e.g. maturity before start)
- Flat `0` notional or interest rates

**Solutions:**

- Call `contract.validate_terms()` manually to identify missing terms
- Check contract definition for startDate, maturityDate, and notionalPrincipal
- Confirm dates are in ISO 8601 format

## üìâ ValueAnalysis Fails with Curve Lookup Error

**Symptoms:**

- `ValueError: No curve found with marketObjectCode='...'`
- Or: `"Cannot compute NPV..."`

**Causes:**

- Curve not attached or not passed to `generateEvents()`
- Wrong marketObjectCode
- Missing `value` or `rate` column in curve data

**Solutions:**

- Pass curves as `riskFactors=[...]` to `generateEvents()`
- Check `marketObjectCode` matches exactly
- Inspect curve with `print(risk_factor._data.head())`

---

## üß™ Analysis Returns Empty or Zero Results

**Symptoms:**

- `.results` is an empty DataFrame
- `.summarize()` returns zero values

**Causes:**

- Analysis period does not overlap with events
- Payoff column contains only zeros
- Filters (e.g., `type in [...]`) match nothing

**Solutions:**

- Use `cf_stream.show(full=True)` to inspect events
- Adjust `start` and `end` in analysis
- Verify expected event types (`IP`, `PR`, etc.)

---

## üñº Plotting Displays Empty or Incomplete Charts

**Symptoms:**

- No arrows/labels in contract plot
- Bar charts are flat or empty

**Causes:**

- No events of plotted types (e.g., `IP`, `IED`, `PR`)
- Filtering removed important rows
- Missing nominal values or accrued interest

**Solutions:**

- Confirm your contract produces expected events
- Call `.show()` before plotting
- Check that events include `payoff`, `nominalValue`, etc.

---

## üîç Debugging Tips

- Use `contract.describe()` or `str(contract)` to print term status
- Inspect event DataFrame directly via `cf_stream.events_df`
- Use `.plot(return_fig=True)` to intercept and save plots
- Print curve JSON: `print(curve.to_json())`

---

## ‚úÖ Additional Recommendations

- **Avoid setting `contractType` manually**: It's auto-injected by the contract class
- **Use named risk factors** (`marketObjectCode`) for clear curve/analysis routing
- **Use consistent date formats** (ISO8601, `YYYY-MM-DD`)
- **Bundle everything** (contracts, curves) into `generateEvents()` for reproducibility
- **Advanced:** Check Sourcecode for commented print statements labeled with [DEBUG] and uncomment them
